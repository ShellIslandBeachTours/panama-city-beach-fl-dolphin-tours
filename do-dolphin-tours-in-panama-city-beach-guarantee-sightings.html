<div><p>Harassment is the act of following, tormenting and/or chasing an animal and can also include any act that disrupts their natural behavior. To this list, I would also add jumping into water. It is ethical to allow wild dolphins to swim with you.</p><p>Tail slaps might mean many different things in different situations. One example is a sign it's time for the dog to get out of the area. <b>Shells</b>  You may use it to call your friends, who might be further away. Whales and dolphins sometimes slap their heads to catch fish.</p><p>Naples-Fort Myers Florida. The Florida coast offers many great spots for dolphin sightings.

<div> <p>Caladesi Island (located at the northern tip of Clearwater Beach) is worth a mention as it's very similar to beaches in the Caribbean. Its turquoise waters are surrounded by sugar-soft white sands and makes it one of Florida's prettiest strands.</p><p>We'll take you into the water before the dolphins arrive. So the dolphins will come to us instead of swimming away. Shell Island Beach Tours has 6 passengers, including children. Our snorkel gear can be put on quickly so you don't have to worry about getting in trouble with the dolphins. There are five boats with identical designs for larger groups. The new Large Family Shell Island Beach Tours can accommodate up to 13 guests. <b>Paradise</b>  Pets are not allowed onboard boats.</p><p>Captain John, as well as Layla, was a great sidekick. We saw dolphins, got in the water with them, and saw turtles as well as rays and crabs. <i>Growth</i>  He also took us on a private trip to find shells, and returned with our full bucket. We were able to personalize it to what we wanted, as we had a 13-year-old and a 10 year-old. Everyone !!!" had an amazing time.</p></div>
