<div> <p>In order to protect the well-being of these wonderful marine creatures, Florida law prohibits swimming with dolphins as well as touching or feeding them. <b>Leisure</b>  Officers from the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission are on the water to ensure that these rules are followed. <b>Testimony</b>  However, you may be lucky enough to have dolphins approach the tour boat quite closely, giving you an excellent view and great photo opportunity. If you would really like to have the possibility of encountering wild dolphins in the water, taking one of our Shell Island Snorkel Tours is a good option as the dolphins sometimes swim near snorkelers.</p><p>Dolphins are usually seen at dawn and dusk, when the water is calm. Feeding activities will usually be observed on an outgoing wave. Panama Beach Dolphin Tours is the best dolphin tour operator. It is usually available on the water most days of the year.</p><p>Swim with Dolphins Panama City Beach, as well as the Dolphin Encounter, will bring you close to these intelligent creatures. They are friendly and playful, so they're easy to hug.</p></div>
