<div> <p>May, June, and July are the best months for dolphin watching off the Azores, Ireland and Madeira coasts. Many of these areas still provide ideal conditions well into August and September.</p><p>While you might have seen dolphins at sea in a marine reserve, it is still far more fun to observe these majestic animals in their natural environment. Our captains are experienced in the waterways of St. Andrew Bay and can predict wild dolphin behavior, but they cannot guarantee sightings. Our captains are familiar with the best places to find dolphins and will make sure that guests have a blast. You will see dolphins playing, hunting for food, communicating and jumping on all tours.</p><p>Shell Island is technically not an island, at high tide. Footpaths to it are still open to the public.</p><br><br><h2>Panama City Beach dolphin exploration voyages - Harbor</h2><ul><li>Jet-ski</li><li>Harbor</li><li>Testimony</li><li>Growth</li><li>Shells</li><li>Skill</li><li>Paradise</li><li>Leisure</li><li>Photography</li><li>Waves</li></ul></div>

Highlight of our trip!”</p><p>How to interact with wild dolphins. Dolphins are able to eat many sea creatures, including fish, crustaceans and squid. However, other foods are not allowed. Don't touch dolphins. Learn the laws. ... Keep an eye out for signs of behavioral problems.</p><p>Imagine cruising over the Gulf of Mexico on a boat or jet ski alongside a pod of bottlenose dolphins. The salty breeze is blowing through your hair, the sun is shining, and all's right with the world as you find adventure along the coast beside these marine creatures.</p> <i>Harbor</i></div>

While wild dolphins can be unpredictable and sightings may not occur on every trip, our captains have been on the waters of St. Andrew Bay for years. They are experts in the locations where dolphins might be found. <i>Leisure</i>  Our captains will ensure that you have a wonderful time. Dolphins can often be seen playing, searching out food, and communicating with one other on most tours.</p><p>DO NOT TOUCH dolphins. If the dolphins are interested in physical contact, they will make it happen. If you try touching one dolphin, they will all leave the area. The swim can not only adversely affect the dolphin behavior, but it can also cause irritation for the rest of the group.</p></div>
