<div> <p>Florida Bay is home to Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphins. It is the largest body in the Everglades. This brackish, shallow water body is home to approximately 450 resident dolphins. Their best friend? Hire an Airboat to see these beautiful creatures in their Everglades habitat.</p><p>It takes approximately twenty minutes to get to the island. This ride offers great chances of seeing dolphins, manatees and sea turtles. <i>Testimony</i>  The green ferry boat takes us to Shell Key and we often spot seabirds.</p><p>You can also enjoy a variety of outdoor activities such as swimming, kayaking, snorkeling and golf. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Destin is to make a short trip to Gulf World and swim alongside the dolphins.</p></div>

They do this because they have to. These are not natural behaviors and all captive dolphins are trained to perform them correctly. If they don't, they won't eat.</p></div>
