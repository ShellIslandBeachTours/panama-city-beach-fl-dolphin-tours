The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity.

You can choose from any of the local outfitters to set off on a daytime, or evening, sightseeing tour that explores St. Andrews Bay or the clear waters around Shell Island.

<div><p>Sigsbee Deep marks the Gulf of Mexico’s deepest point. It is situated at 17,070ft (5203m) below the Mexico Basin sea level.</p><p>The "Belly Ride" involves touching the bellies of a dolphin while you hold onto their pectoral Fins as they swim about in the lagoon. The last activity is called the "Boogie Push". This is similar to the Foot Push, except you will be pushing a boogie board.</p><p>Dolphins are most likely to be seen whenever the sun is out, and the waters are calm and clear. <b>Harbor</b>  Feeding activities usually take place on an outgoing tide. Panama Beach Dolphin Tours is a great option. They are on the water almost every day of year.</p></div>
