"text": "Dolphinaria might have you believe that dolphins are not apex predators of the ocean. They can kill sharks and should be treated accordingly. The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity. However, they are not domesticated."

<div><p>A dolphin cruise is one of the top activities in PCB. You can choose one of the many local outfitters before you set out on a daytime tour or an evening sightseeing tour. This will allow you to explore St. Andrews Bay, Shell Island and the clear waters surrounding it. You don’t have to stay in the watercraft. A few excursions add snorkeling time for an unforgettable Gulf Coast experience.</p><p>Harassment means to pursue, torture, and/or chase animals. This is any act that can disrupt their natural behaviors. I would add swimming in the ocean to this list. To swim with wild dolphins ethically is to allow them to take the lead.</p><p>Panama City Beach is renowned for its dolphin encounters.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach Dolphin Adventure Trips - Beach</h2><ol><li>Shells</li><li>Skill</li><li>Paradise</li><li>Leisure</li><li>Photography</li><li>Waves</li><li>Heritage</li><li>Joy</li><li>Crew</li><li>Quest</li><li>Eco-tourism</li><li>Tale</li><li>Pier</li><li>Bay</li></ol> The dolphins are friendly, and they are used to visitors.

<div> <p>Sea water is an effective disinfectant but interaction with wild dolphins could lead to disease transmission. These can pose serious health risks to both dolphins and humans. Swimming with dolphins is considered harassment and you don't want to be fined.</p><p>The Gulf of Mexico is home to many species of sharks. <b>Leisure</b>  <i>Shells</i>  The most common sharks found along our coast are the Bull Shark and Thresher Shark.</p><p>Harassment refers to chasing, torturing and/or following animals. It is any act that may disrupt their natural behaviors. I'd add jumping in the water to that list. If you want to swim with wild dolphins ethically it is best to let them take charge.</p></div>

<div> <p>Sigsbee Deep marks the Gulf of Mexico’s deepest point. It is situated at 17,070ft (5203m) below the Mexico Basin sea level.</p><p>The "Belly Ride" involves touching the bellies of a dolphin while you hold onto their pectoral Fins as they swim about in the lagoon. <b>Skill</b>  The last activity is called the "Boogie Push". This is similar to the Foot Push, except you will be pushing a boogie board.</p><p>Dolphins are most likely to be seen whenever the sun is out, and the waters are calm and clear. Feeding activities usually take place on an outgoing tide. Panama Beach Dolphin Tours is a great option. They are on the water almost every day of year.</p> </div>
