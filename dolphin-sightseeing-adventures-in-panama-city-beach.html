<div><p>The dolphins of St. Andrew Bay are wild animals, so it is impossible to predict the best time to see them. Dolphin behavior is influenced by the season, weather conditions, water temperatures, tide cycles, and availability of prey among many other factors. Generally, there is a good chance of seeing dolphins any time the sun is out and the water is calm and clear. <b>Shells</b>  Feeding activities are normally seen on an outgoing tide. Your best bet is to choose a dolphin tour operator like Panama Beach Dolphin Tours that is on the water nearly every day of the year.</p><p>The Atlantic Ocean Bottlenose Dolphins can be found throughout the oceans of the globe. However, their greatest numbers are found in the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>There are many species of dolphins that can be found in Panama City Beach. However, the most common and well-known dolphins are the bottlenose dolphins.</p></div>

<div><p>Dolphins do not have gills like fish. Dolphins can breathe oxygen from the atmosphere, but also remain in salt water. The dolphin can remain in the water and still take in oxygen by jumping out.
