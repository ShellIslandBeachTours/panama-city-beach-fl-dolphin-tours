<div><p>A dolphin tour can also be a great sightseeing opportunity. All tour boats depart Adventure at Sea in Lower Grand Lagoon. They cruise south and cross the pass between St. Andrew Bay, the Gulf of Mexico and Shell Island. While you can take in the beautiful view, spot seabirds and possibly a turtle, keep your eyes open for dolphins.</p><p>Comfortable and appropriate clothing is essential for dolphin swimming. For women, we recommend that you wear a full-body swimsuit and for men, shorts.</p><p>Captain John was wonderful as well as his side kick, Layla. We saw multiple dolphins, jumped in with them, saw turtles, rays and crabs. He also took us to a private beach to search for shells and carried our bucket full back for us. <i>Beach</i>  It was great to customize for what we wanted to do as we had a 14, 12 and 10 year old. Great time was had by all!!!”</p></div>

<div> <p>Dolphinaria might have you believe that dolphins are not apex predators of the ocean. They can kill sharks and should be treated accordingly. The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity. However, they are not domesticated.</p><p>Shell Island boasts a diverse array of wildlife including dolphins.</p><p>Exploring Shell Island, St Andrews Bay & the Gulf of Mexico is exciting and different every time you come. Snorkeling the grass flats and shallows of the island is for the whole family. We offer small group and personal tours for a customized wildlife adventure. <b>Growth</b>  This tour has it all! We are EXPERTS at family fun and have been doing this for over 30 years.</p> </div>

The dolphins will be more likely to swim towards us than away, this way. <b>Photography</b>  Shell Island Beach Tours can only carry 6 people (children included) instead of the larger tour boats which can hold up to 150 people. With your snorkel gear on, we can get you in the water quickly without causing any splashing or disruptions which often scares the dolphins. There are 5 boats that can be used for larger groups.
